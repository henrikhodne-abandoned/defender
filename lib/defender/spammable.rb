module Defender
  # Includes all the model magic for Defender. This module should be included in
  # your model to enable Defender on it. Defender does some automatic detection
  # on your setup, but you need to do some configuration yourself. You can set
  # the API key in two different ways. If you only use Defender on one model,
  # you can configure the API key in the model with the configure_defender
  # method. If you prefer to use initializers, or you have multiple models, you
  # probably want to define it in an initializer. You can do this by calling
  # Defender.api_key directly, like this:
  #
  #   Defender.api_key = 'This is your API key'
  #
  # Defender only requires your models to have a before_save callback, but since
  # most ActiveModel libraries should have this you only need to worry about it
  # if you're making your own models. Just have a look at
  # Defender::Test::Comment for an example comment model.
  module Spammable
    # Public: These are the default attribute names Defender will pull
    # information from if no other names are configured. So the content of the
    # comment will be pulled from 'body', if that attribute exists. Otherwise,
    # it will be pulled from 'content'. If that doesn't exist either, it will
    # pull from 'comment'. If that attribute doesn't exist either, you should
    # configure your own attributes with the configure_defender method.
    DEFENSIO_KEYS = {
      'content' => [:body, :content, :comment],
      'author-name' => [:author_name, :author],

    # Public: Methods that will be included as class methods when including
    # Defender::Spammable into your model.
    module ClassMethods
      # Public: Configures various Defender options.
      #
      # options - The hash options used to configure Defender:
      #           :keys      - A Hash which maps field names in the database to
      #                        Defensio field names (optional).
      #           :api_key   - Your Defensio API key String (optional).
      #           :test_mode - Set this to true to enable the test mode. See
      #                        Defender.test_mode for more information.
      #
      # Examples
      #
      #   configure_defender :keys => { 'content' => :comment_content },
      #     :api_key => 'Your API key.', :test_mode => true
